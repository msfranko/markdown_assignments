#Code Snippet Breakdowns:

(I MADE A CHANGE)

`git help`-- tells you commonly used git commands

`git config`-- get and set repository or global options**

`git init` â€” makes a new git repository: <http://classic.scottr.org/presentations/git-in-5-minutes/>

<http://git-scm.com/docs/git-init>


`git status` -- after you've changed files, you run git status to see what will happen after you commit them

`git add` -- git add filename adds files to your repository

`git commit`-- after the file has been added you need to commit (actually store in) to the repository: git commit -m "adding files" (record changes to repository)

`git commit -a -m "message"`

`git rm`-- removes files from the repo

`git log`--shows a log of the changes/commits <http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log>

`git diff`-- Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc <http://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff>
