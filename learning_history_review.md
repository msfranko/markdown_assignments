#Reviewing My Learnig History




**What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?**

*When I was younger, I would shut off immediately if I did not understand something.  I interpreted that to be a reflection of my intelligene level versus just the time and energy it takes to master a difficult skill.  I was able to reframe this during college math, where I now saw it about my ability to stay with a concept and untangle it.  Perfectionism and extremeism have also been double-edged swords.  Sometimes it takes me a long time to just begin a project, or I obsess over minute details.  I've come to understand perfect is the enemy of done and it is better to have something to work with and come back to than nothing at all.  While these two traits have lead me sometimes to procrstinate, I've also read that for those who know they have the skills to finish something, adding time pressure is actually a decent strategy and when I give myself a real deadline, I do produce.  However, this means I am in hyper anxiety mode until I just start.  More recently, due in part to physical constraints, my ability to do this has changed, and my cognitive energy and focus have become much more precious to me.*

**How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?**

*I invoke a combination of life-coaching and tiger-momming myself: Firstly, I need to relax. I need to consider the big picture when my perfectionism kicks in and just start.  But then I also need to tell myself things like 'Sit down and just START. Are you afraid? Are you not even going to try?! We don't quit at half-time! Spartan Up!' I personally need to be extremely careful not to let myself get run down, or my neurology will start to shut down.*


**What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?**

*I learn best through active participation, and when I am motivated through projects and problems with real-world and/or personal relevance.  I learn better in a 'safe', respectful space where I connect with both peers and instructors.

In terms of project management, working collaboratively (at leat in part) is helpful because we hold each other accountable.  It is easier to get moving when there are multiple people (safety in numbers!)

Also, not being afraid to look like an idiot and sit next to the smartest person in the room work for me.  I've learned to ask questions instead of waiting, and I'll pick up from the people who really know what they are doing.*

**Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)**

*I need to try out office hours.  
I also need to figure out who the smartest person in the class is!*

**What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?**

*My neurology sometimes hinders processing time.  I'm terrified I won't physically be able to handle this and have to drop out.*

**Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?**

*Unfortunately, yes. I have to managae my time and I need to get adequate sleep.  There might be days when I'm a little slower, but I need to do the best I can at the given time.*
